# Singapore-Data-Engineering-Meetup
This repository will keep all the presentation materials for [Singapore Data Engineering Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Data-Engineering-Meetup/)

# What we are about
Handling big amounts of data is not an easy task. Data engineering requires different skills sets from distributed systems, programming to data analysis, and so on.
The goal of this group is to create a community to help building tools and systems to create products and answer questions with data, using software engineering best practices, computer science fundamentals, database and distributed systems principles.
